            Cryptocurrency is a type of digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for security, making it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. Unlike traditional currencies issued by governments and central banks, cryptocurrencies operate on decentralized networks based on blockchain technologyâ€”a distributed ledger enforced by a network of computers (called nodes). Bitcoin, the first and most well-known cryptocurrency, was introduced in 2009 and sparked the development of thousands of alternative coins, or "altcoins," such as Ethereum, Litecoin, and Solana. Cryptocurrencies can be used for various purposes, including investment, online purchases, and even as a way to raise capital through Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). While they offer benefits like lower transaction fees, global accessibility, and privacy, cryptocurrencies are also known for their volatility and regulatory uncertainty.
